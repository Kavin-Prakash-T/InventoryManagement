# Retail Inventory Management System

## Problem Statement
Retail shops face challenges in managing their inventory effectively:
- Difficulty in tracking available stock
- Errors in manual updates of product details
- Lack of proper reporting for decision-making
- No role-based access to separate admin and staff operations  

To solve these issues, we need a simple, secure, and role-based **Inventory Management System**.

## Project Description
The **Retail Inventory Management System** is a **console-based Java application** built using **JDBC and MySQL**.  
It allows shop owners and staff to efficiently manage inventory with features like:

- **Role-based login**  
  - **Admin:** Can add, update, delete, and view products, as well as generate reports  
  - **Staff:** Can only view stock levels and generate reports  

- **Product Management (CRUD)**  
  - Add new products  
  - Update existing products  
  - Delete products  
  - Search and display all products  

- **Report Generation**  
  - Stock report (current stock levels)  
  - Sales report (product sales history)  
  - Reports can be exported as `.txt` files  

The system ensures **data consistency** using a **MySQL database** and demonstrates **OOP principles** like inheritance, abstraction, and runtime polymorphism.
